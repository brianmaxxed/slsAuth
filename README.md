# serverlessAuth

This is just a coding example project showcasing my ability to write ES6+ code for a backend NodeJS Express API that can be deployed to AWS via serverless.com's utilities.

There is a .env file that has a sample MongoDB test DB setup for the time beihg.
I will remove that DB if too much traffic hits in the next week or two and notify those who requested to see this code.


Technologies Used:
NodeJs 8.10
MongoDB
Mongoose 5.1
Express 4
ElastiCache Redis
JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt, etc.

webpack
nodemon
ES2018+ (lots of async/await and other goodies)
ESLint
Jest

see package.json for more details.

Basically:

install:
yarn

build: 
yarn build

test:
yarn test
yarn test:watch

run:
yarn start

watch:
yarn watch
